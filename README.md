# ProcessingSketches

A collection of Processing sketches I have created. An overview of how each of the sketches operates can be found as a README in each separate sketch directory. Alternatively, you can click the links below which will take you to the sketch directories.

Be sure to follow my instagram account at www.instagram.com/degenerativepixels/ ! I post generative art in my free time, and upload many of the pieces here with explanations.

Note: Some sketches may not have a full README in their directory yet. More sketches are being added all the time, and the README will generally come out a few days after the sketch has been completed.
